# T02 Single-Page-Application for Festival Organization (Web-Technologien)

Authors: Alice Alferink & Emilia Kistowski

## Description
The Website is a simple web application that aims to help with the organization of the festival "Rock am See".
On top of the site a countdown shows the time left until the festival starts. Three further sections display information, events and a list of helpers, who have registered to volunteer at one of the events. Via a dropdown menu the list of helpers can be sorted by name or registration date, in descending or ascending order. On top of the page there is a fixed navigation bar, that enables the user to jump to all three sections of the site quickly. During loading of the helpers information, a three-dot animation signifies the loading process.
