# T04 Single-Page-Application for Festival Reviews (Web-Technologien)

Authors: Alice Alferink & Emilia Kistowski

## Description -> Update
The festival has ended, and the organizers want to offer visitors a way to provide feedback. This single-page application allows festival attendees to share their experiences and rate the event with one to five stars. Once a review is submitted, it appears as a card on the website. Thanks to the use of localStorage, these review cards remain visible even after closing and reopening the site on the same local browser.
