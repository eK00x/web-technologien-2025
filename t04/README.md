# T04 Single-Page Application for Festival Experience Reports (Web-Technologien)

Authors: Alice Alferink & Emilia Kistowski

## Description
The website "Rock am See â€“ Experience Reports" is a Single-Page Application (SPA) developed using Svelte and Bootstrap. It enables festival visitors to share and view experience reports. All submitted reports are stored locally in the browserâ€™s localStorage to prevent data loss.

The app includes a form for entering feedback (username, rating, title, and message). It performs basic validation and displays the submitted entries below the form as styled cards arranged in a responsive grid. Star ratings are visualized, with full ratings (5 stars) highlighted in yellow and partial ratings displayed with grey stars.
